# AST Framework

AST-Framework is a versatile C++ framework designed to simplify game development. It provides essential features such as scene management, input handling, rendering, and rectangle manipulation. Additionally, it offers sprite management and supports the integration of physics simulations. The framework is easy to use and customizable, making it suitable for creating a wide range of games. With AST-Framework, developers can focus on creating engaging gameplay experiences without getting bogged down in low-level implementation details.
## Installation

To use the AST-Framework in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mastercuber55/AST-Framework.git
   ```

2. Copy the `AST.h` and `AST.cpp` files from the AST-Framework repository and include them in your `main.cpp` file.

3. Create a folder named "Resources" in the root directory of your project. Inside the "Resources" folder, create a subfolder named "GFX". This is where you should store your graphical assets (textures, sprites, etc.).

4. (Optional) Create a folder named "Scenes" in the root directory of your project. This step is recommended but not necessary. Inside the "Scenes" folder, create a file named "Scenes.h". In this file, you can define your scenes using the provided framework.

5. Create individual scene files such as "Scene_Example.cpp" inside the "Scenes" folder for each scene you want to create. Make sure to include the "Scenes.h" file at the top of each scene file and provide definitions for any class members or classes that are defined in "Scenes.h". Refer to the "Examples" section in this README for sample code and usage examples.

6. Configure your build system to include the AST-Framework files (`AST.h` and `AST.cpp`) and any additional dependencies during the compilation process. Refer to the documentation of your build system for instructions on how to include source files and external dependencies.

7. You're ready to start using the AST-Framework in your project! Implement your own scenes and utilize the framework's features based on the examples and documentation provided.

Remember to place your graphical assets in the "Resources/GFX" folder.

If you encounter any issues or have questions, submit it in [issuses tab](https://github.com/mastercuber55/AST-Framework/issues) and the associated documentation for support.
## Note

By default, the AST-Framework does not include the Physics Engine and SDL_image library. However, you can enable these features by following these steps:

- To enable the Physics Engine, you need to pass the compiler flag `-DAST_PHYSICS` during the build process. This will enable the physics-related functionalities provided by the framework.

- If you want to use SDL_image for loading and rendering images, you need to pass the compiler flag `-DAST_TEXTURE` during the build process. This will enable the integration with SDL_image and allow you to load and use various image formats in your project.

Make sure to include the necessary libraries and dependencies in your build configuration when enabling these features. Refer to the documentation of your build system for instructions on how to include the required libraries and flags.

If you don't require the Physics Engine or SDL_image in your project, you can omit these flags during the build process, and the framework will work without them.

Feel free to enable or disable these features based on your project's requirements.
